<h1>About Project</h1>
<p>
	This Proejct Contain mutiple projects, all of which are from Computer Sciences courses of Syracuse University.<br />
	Currently, the projects are all from Professor <a href="www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/">Jim Fawcett</a>, thus he has most copyrights for the lecture material.<br />
	The projects are previous controled by Subversion, the server is <em>VirtualSVN Server Manager</em>. Now they are migrated to Git.<br />
	After I move to Git, I recgonized that it is not good idea to put everything in one repository.
