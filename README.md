#About Project

This Proejct Contain mutiple projects, all of which are from Computer Sciences courses of Syracuse University.    
Currently, the projects are all from Professor [Jim Fawcett](http://www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/), thus he has most copyrights for the lecture material.    
The projects are previous controled by **Subversion**, the server is [VirtualSVN Server Manager](http://www.visualsvn.com/server/). Now they are migrated to Git.    
After I move to Git, I recgonized that it is not good idea to put everything in one repository.     

##CSE686-IP
This contains all project that I have developed in [CSE686 - Internet Programming](http://www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/handouts/webpages/CSE686.htm "Course Page") course in Spring 2011.   
The course using .net MVC in C# and WCF.   
To know more information, please view the [course home page](http://www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/handouts/webpages/CSE686.htm) from Jim Fawcett's class website.   


##CSE687-OOD
This contains most materials that I have got and developed in [CSE687 - Object Oriented Design](http://www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/handouts/webpages/CSE687.htm "Course Page") course in Spring 2011.    
This course using C++ to demonstrate the principle of Object Oriented Design. I learned much more knowledge of OO than I learned from C#, as the C# has done too much for programmer. And I begin to love C++ after this class.    
Under CSE687-OOD, there are three folders:    

- [Examples](SU-Courses/tree/master/CSE687-OOD/Examples "Go into folder")    

> The example demos that download from Professor Fawcett's Class.   
	
- [Lectures](SU-Courses/tree/master/CSE687-OOD/Lectures "Go into folder")   

> Leature documents that distributed by Professor Fawcett    
	
- [Programs](SU-Courses/tree/master/CSE687-OOD/Programs "Go into folder")    

> Programs that I developed for the assignments from the course.    
> **Test** folder contains programs used for testing part fuctinoality.    
> **Assignments** folder contains four programs, in each foled, there is \.doc file that descripts the requirement.
