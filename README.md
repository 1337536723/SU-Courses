#About Project

This Proejct Contain mutiple projects, all of which are from Computer Sciences courses of Syracuse University.
Currently, the projects are all from Professor [Jim Fawcett](http://www.lcs.syr.edu/faculty/fawcett/), thus he has most copyrights for the lecture material.
The projects are previous controled by Subversion, the server is *VirtualSVN Server Manager*. Now they are migrated to Git.
After I move to Git, I recgonized that it is not good idea to put everything in one repository.
